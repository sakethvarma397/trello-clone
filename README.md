# Trello clone

Basic Trello clone with the functionality to support unlimited Boards, Lists and Tasks.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Known Issues
- [ ] Memory leak 
Deleting board should delete all the associated lists and tasks from storage. Likewise deleting the list should delete all the tasks. How to chain these actions?

- [ ] Typing an invalid list name and hitting the add list button would close the textarea as if the list is being created. However the list will not be created because of the type validation. Need to figure out a way to stop the onBlur from closing the textarea when there is a type validation.

- [ ] The boards section is not fixed. 
When the board has too many lists, the user has to scroll all the way to the left inorder to switch to another board.

- [ ] Key actions are not handled properly while editing task/board/list names.
While editing the names, I would usually expect hitting enter should automatically save the state.


## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Write more tests.
Added some snapshot tests for a reducer, just to understand how tests are written for React applications. (Never tested React application before)
Yet to learn how to test Components.
- [ ] Add completed tasks section.
Tried adding an accordion in the end of the list but it disturbed the Drag and drop behaviour. Couldnâ€™t figure out how to fix the issue.
- [ ] Performance Analysis.
Never looked into the performance aspects of a React application. Should learn the concepts and access the performance of this application.
- [ ] Add more task attributes and UI to customize these attributes.
Embed Rich text editor in the Task Modal.
- [ ] Support key events.
- [ ] Better UI to notify invalid inputs.
- [ ] Consistent UI for all inputs.
